00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.870
(One, two, three, four)

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.750
Today has a way of scarring your eyes

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.280
With negative light, but it's a disguise

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.930
I put on my shades and see through the lies

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.760
The convenient truth is

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.150
Light is on the way, we'll be having a fun time

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.690
It's such a lovely day, we should pocket the sunshine

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.120
And never give it back, even if there's a heat wave

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.760
Or terrorist attack, it will just be a close shave

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.270
I know (I know)

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.650
That every bomb has a silver lining

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.460
I know (I know)

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.200
It won't be long until

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.270
Everything works out nice in the end

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.330
The sun will marry the moon

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.000
It'll be fine

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.370
Why don't we sit back, mellow again

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.550
And have a nice afternoon?

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.640
It'll be fine

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.200
I go for a walk, the sidewalk is cracked

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.850
I'm not superstitious, but I made a pact

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.210
With old Mother Earth, she'd get off my back

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.170
If I get off hers

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.610
Light is on the way, we'll be having a fun time

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.170
It's such a lovely day, we should pocket the sunshine

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.680
And never give it back, even if there's a heat wave

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.290
We're stalling on the track, it will just be a close shave

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.870
I know (I know)

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.900
That in a snap, all the birds will sing

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.830
I know (I know)

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.510
I'm full of crap, but still

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.610
Everything works out nice in the end

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.980
The sun will marry the moon

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.600
It'll be fine

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.850
Why don't we sit back, mellow again

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.050
And have a nice afternoon?

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.950
It'll be fine

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.250
Fine, fine, fine

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.980
Everything is gonna be

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.220
Fine, fine, fine

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.020
Everything is gonna be

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.330
Fine, fine, fine

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.280
Everything is gonna be

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.530
Fine, fine, fine

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.940
Everything is gonna be

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.620
Everything works out nice in the end

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.830
The sun will marry the moon

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.580
It'll be fine

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.670
Why don't we sit back, mellow again

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.950
And have a nice afternoon?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.590
It'll be fine

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.830
Everything works out nice in the end (I know)

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.470
The sun will marry the moon (that every bomb)

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.760
Works out nice in the end (has a silver lining, I know)

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.950
Why don't we sit back mellow again (I know)

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.330
And have a nice afternoon? (It won't be long until)

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.850
Sit back mellow again

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.050
Everything works out nice in the end

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.100
The sun will marry the moon

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.960
It'll be fine

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.070
Why don't we sit back mellow again

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.310
And have a nice afternoon?

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.170
It'll be fine, fine, fine, fine
