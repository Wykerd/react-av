React AV uses a fully-featured <!-- TODO: and spec compliant --> [W3C WebVTT](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/) parser and renderer written in TypeScript. This implementation is framework agnostic and can be used in any project. This page of the docs will explain the API of this implementation.

Our implementation is available for install via the `@react-av/vtt-core` package. 

```bash
npm i @react-av/vtt-core
```

**This documentation is a work in progress and will be completed once the API is finalized and we've started running spec compliance tests on our implementation.**
